    <h1 class="cikk">Top Things You Should Definitely Do When Visiting Tenerife</h1>
    <p class="cikk">Tenerife, the largest of Spain’s Canary Islands, is a dream destination where volcanic landscapes meet golden beaches, lush forests, and charming towns. Whether you're an adventure seeker, nature lover, or just in need of a sunny escape, Tenerife has something for everyone. Here's a list of things you definitely shouldn't miss when you're in Tenerife:</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="cikk">🌋 1. Hike or Take the Cable Car to Mount Teide</h2>
<p class="cikk">Mount Teide is the highest peak in Spain and a must-visit in Tenerife. The volcano and the surrounding Teide National Park are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. You can take the cable car up to 3,555 meters (11,663 feet), and if you're up for it, hike the final stretch to the summit (permit required) for jaw-dropping views above the clouds.</p>
<p class="cikk"><mark>Tip</mark>: Visit early in the morning or around sunset for fewer crowds and better lighting.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="cikk">🏖️ 2. Relax on Tenerife’s Unique Beaches</h2>
<p class="cikk">Tenerife’s beaches are incredibly diverse. The south offers golden-sand beaches like <mark>Playa de las Américas</mark> and <mark>Playa del Duque</mark>, perfect for sunbathing and swimming. In the north, discover black volcanic sand beaches like <mark>Playa Jardín</mark> in Puerto de la Cruz and <mark>Playa de Benijo</mark>, which is framed by dramatic cliffs and waves.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="cikk">🐬 3. Go Whale and Dolphin Watching</h2>
<p class="cikk">Tenerife is one of the best places in Europe for spotting whales and dolphins in the wild. Boat tours leave regularly from Los Cristianos, Puerto Colón, and Los Gigantes. You can often see pilot whales and bottlenose dolphins all year round.
</p>
<r/>
<h2 class="cikk">🏞️ 4. Explore Anaga Rural Park</h2>
<p class="cikk">For lush green forests, dramatic peaks, and hidden villages, head to the northeastern part of the island. Anaga Rural Park feels like another world, with ancient laurel forests, foggy mountains, and scenic hiking trails.</p>
<p class="cikk"><mark>Don’t miss</mark>: Taganana village, for its remote charm and coastal views.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="cikk">🌊 5. Swim in Natural Pools (Charcos)</h2>
<p class="cikk">Instead of traditional pools, Tenerife offers <mark>charcos</mark> — natural volcanic rock pools formed by the sea. Some of the best ones include <mark>Charco de la Laja, Charco del Viento</mark>, and <mark>Garachico’s El Caletón</mark>.</p>
<p class="cikk"><mark>Note</mark>: Always check the tide and sea conditions before swimming.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="cikk">🏘️ 6. Wander Through La Laguna and La Orotava</h2>
<p class="cikk">Get a taste of Tenerife’s colonial past in <mark>San Cristóbal de La Laguna</mark>, a UNESCO-listed town with colorful buildings and cobbled streets. Nearby <mark>La Orotava</mark> is known for its traditional Canarian architecture, historic mansions, and peaceful gardens.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="cikk">🍷 7. Try Local Food and Wine</h2>
<p class="cikk">Tenerife’s gastronomy is deeply rooted in its culture. Don’t leave without trying:</p>
<ul>
    <li><mark>Papas arrugadas</mark> (wrinkled potatoes with mojo sauce)</li>
    <li><mark>Gofio</mark> (toasted grain flour used in many dishes)</li>
    <li><mark>Fresh seafood</mark><br/>
Also, sample local wines, especially those made from grapes grown on volcanic soil in the <mark>Tacoronte-Acentejo</mark> region.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2 class="cikk">🎉 8. Experience a Fiesta or Carnival</h2>
<p class="cikk">If you're lucky to be in Tenerife in February or March, you might catch <mark>Carnival in Santa Cruz</mark>, the second-largest carnival in the world after Rio de Janeiro. Colorful costumes, parades, music, and all-night dancing await.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="cikk">9.Take a Road Trip Around the Island</h2>
<p class="cikk">Renting a car gives you the freedom to explore Tenerife’s varied landscapes—from dry, desert-like south to the misty green north. Stop at viewpoints (miradores), small villages, and hidden beaches along the way.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="cikk">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p class="cikk">Tenerife is not just a beach holiday—it's a vibrant mix of natural wonders, cultural gems, and unforgettable experiences. Whether you're here for a weekend or a couple of weeks, make sure you mix adventure with relaxation and soak in everything this unique island has to offer.</p>
<p class="cikk"><mark>Don't forget your sunscreen—and your hiking shoes!</mark></p>
