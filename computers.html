<h1 class="cikk">The History and Evolution of Computers</h1>
<p class="cikk">Computers have become an integral part of modern life, shaping industries, economies, and everyday experiences. However, the powerful machines we rely on today are the result of centuries of innovation and development. This article traces the fascinating history of computers, from ancient calculating tools to the sophisticated systems of the 21st century.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="cikk">1. The Pre-Computer Era: Mechanical Beginnings</h2>
<p class="cikk">Long before electronic computers existed, humans developed tools to aid in calculation.</p>
<h3 class="cikk">The Abacus (c. 2400 BCE)</h3>
<p class="cikk">The earliest known computing tool, the abacus, was used in ancient Mesopotamia and China. It allowed users to perform arithmetic operations using beads and rods.</p>
<img class="cikk" alt="an image of the abacus"  width="300px" src="./images/The+Abacus-removebg-preview.png">
<h3 class="cikk">Mechanical Calculators (17th Century)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><mark>Blaise Pascal</mark> invented the Pascaline in 1642, a mechanical device capable of adding and subtracting.</li>
    <li><mark>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</mark> later improved on this with a calculator that could also multiply and divide.</li>
</ul>
<p class="cikk">These inventions laid the groundwork for automated computing.</p>

<hr/>
<h2 class="cikk">2. The Analytical Age: Concepts of Programmability</h2>
<h3 class="cikk">Charles Babbage and the Analytical Engine</h3>
<p class="cikk">In the early 19th century, English mathematician Charles Babbage conceptualized the <mark>Analytical Engine</mark>, a mechanical general-purpose computer. Though never built in his lifetime, it had many features of modern computers, including an arithmetic logic unit and the use of punch cards for input.</p>
<img class="cikk" alt="an image of the Analytical engine" width="300px" src="./images/OIP-removebg-preview.png">
<h3 class="cikk">Ada Lovelace: The First Programmer</h3>
<p class="cikk">Working with Babbage, Ada Lovelace created what is considered the first algorithm intended for implementation on a machine, earning her the title of the world’s first computer programmer.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2 class="cikk">3. The Electromechanical Era (1930s–1940s)</h2>
<h3 class="cikk">The Z3 (1941)</h3>
<p class="cikk">German engineer Konrad Zuse developed the <mark>Z3</mark>, the first fully functional programmable electromechanical computer. It used binary arithmetic and floating-point numbers.</p>
<img class="cikk" alt="an image of the z3" width="300px" src="./images/zuse-z3-2.jpg">
<h3 class="cikk">Harvard Mark I (1944)</h3>
<p class="cikk">Built by IBM and Harvard University, this massive electromechanical computer performed complex calculations for the U.S. Navy during World War II.</p>
<img class="cikk" alt="an image of the harvard mark 1" width="300px" src="./images/harvardmark11.jpg">
<hr/>

<h3 class="cikk">ENIAC (1945)</h3>
<p class="cikk"><mark>The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC)</mark> was the first general-purpose electronic digital computer. It used vacuum tubes and could perform thousands of calculations per second.</p>
<img class="cikk" alt="an image of the eniac" width="300px" src="./images/what-is-eniac-1690362261.jpg">
<h3 class="cikk">Characteristics of First-Generation Computers</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Used vacuum tubes</li>
    <li>Large, power-hungry, and unreliable</li>
    <li>Programmed with machine language</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<h2 class="cikk">5. Second Generation (1950s–1960s): The Transistor Age</h2>
<p class="cikk">With the invention of the <mark>transistor</mark> in 1947, computers became smaller, faster, and more reliable.</p>
<h3 class="cikk">Key Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Used magnetic core memory</li>
    <li>Programs written in assembly languages</li>
    <li>Commercial computers like the IBM 1401 emerged</li>
</ul>
<img class="cikk" alt="image of a transistor" width="300px" src="./images/OIP (4).webp">
<hr/>
<h2 class="cikk">6. Third Generation (1960s–1970s): Integrated Circuits</h2>
<h3 class="cikk">Integrated Circuits (ICs)</h3>
<p class="cikk">Introduced in the 1960s, ICs allowed thousands of transistors to be placed on a single chip, revolutionizing computing power and efficiency.</p>
<h3 class="cikk">Development Highlights</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Emergence of operating systems</li>
    <li>Time-sharing and multiprocessing</li>
    <li>Mainframes like the <mark>IBM System/360</mark> dominated business and government use

</li>
